  "guesser_description": "In this section, you can find out the names of the chords you create yourself. Just select frets on the virtual fretboard to form your chords. The app analyzes your shapes and gives each one a name. You can add several chords, reorder them, and once you have at least two, move on to the next sections. It’s a fun way to test your ear and learn the names of the shapes you play.",

Just send one of the chords you’ve already defined, and the system will show multiple positions all along the neck. You can swap any of them with your original chord to discover new sounds.

Use the chords you’ve already named and add a short prompt describing how many you want, what style you’re going for, or the feeling you’d like to convey.

Once you pick both, the system shows you every possible chord position on the fretboard. If you’ve already selected some chords for your session or song, they’ll appear on screen too, so you can easily keep track of them. From there, you can also add any new chord you find in the search — simple and quick!",
